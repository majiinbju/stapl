The project is set at the foot of Kharghar hills that lies to its west, flanked by a school in the north, a recreational open space to the south; the main access road and the node of Kharghar to the east. 

As per governing byelaws, permissible land use was residential, and the specified floor space index was 1. The brief was to not just produce an apartment complex but to go beyond and conceptualize a master plan that met the aspirations of the residents.

The low floor space index gave a huge flexibility and impetus to work on plans that were linear generating a vast quantum of open space. As the design progressed, it became clear that all the built form would be long, strip-like structures on the periphery of the plot, with a large open landscaped green at the center. This space was the derivative of the masterplan that would cater to the spatial and recreational needs of the people. 

The final built form was three linear buildings located towards the west, north and east of the plot. Each consisting of two wings, and each wing having three apartments per floor. All the apartments were planned to have unrestricted view of the central landscaped area. While the end apartments additionally achieved the much-needed cross ventilation.
