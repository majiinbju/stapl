Caption:

The building fagade was visualized as a clean set of horizontal and vertical lines. The external driveway at the base accesses the entrance lobbies and the 430 car parks that are located directly below the central landscape. This clearly segregated the vehicular traffic and limited it to the ground floor level, ensuring that the first-floor landscape area was purely pedestrian. 

The acute shortage of recreational open spaces in the city was addressed by this large landscaped podium of approximately 90,000 sq. ft. The podium garden was fashioned along the lines of a resort with meditation space, meandering pathways, a walk-in wave swimming pool, jogging track & informal outdoor meeting garden and a clubhouse. Thus, the design was conceptualized as a living envelope around it.
