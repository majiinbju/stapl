Caption: The low floor space index gave a huge flexibility and impetus to work on plans that were linear generating a vast quantum of open space. As the design progressed, it became clear that all the built form would be long, strip-like structures on the periphery of the plot, with a large open landscaped green at the center. This space was the derivative of the masterplan that would cater to the spatial and recreational needs of the people.
