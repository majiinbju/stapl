SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION 
Ground Floor & First Floor – Retail Section
Second & Third floor - Parking
Fourth Floor – Retail with Podium garden 
Fifth to Twelfth floor - Offices

The building is located on the junction of two, main, 30-meter wide arterial roads in an upcoming node in Navi Mumbai. The site is well connected by different modes of transport.

To augment the potential of the location; the design positioned commercial area on the ground and first floors. Hence, the plan that got generated worked towards ensuring that as much area as possible was built on the ground and upper floor. This ensured that almost 50% of the built-up area was consumed on the lower floors leaving half to be consumed on the floors above. 

The building accommodates approximately 100 car parking spaces on 2nd and 3rd floor; while the office block is distributed on the 9 Upper floors (4th to 12th floor). The fourth floor has a podium garden accessed from the common lobby. This also accommodates a restaurant for the use of the office goers.

The Curtain wall glazing is done in a monochromatic gold glass and the shopping façade is done in black aluminum panels in a linear pattern. This project uses gold as a singular colour palette in keeping with the aspirational quality of the client’s brief.
