The interior spaces are designed based on the theme of 'minimalism', the challenge here being to achieve a resilient language of design elements that bind the house together; yet keeping the space light, simple and simultaneously luxurious. Random clad travertine marble forms the highlight of the the covered car park along with wooden rafters and granite clad flooring. The grey and white theme carries forward into the interiors. This sets the colour palette for the next two levels in white Statuario and Armani grey marble. Leather paneling, mirror cladding and simple lines in the furniture complete and team up with a surprisingly bold back-lit, wild agate marble, central piece. 

A floating column that divided the living room was crafted into a centre-piece in back-lit agate; retaining the spaciousness of the living room. The bedrooms are planned with attached walk-in-wardrobes and are an exercise in restraint retaining the spaciousness. 

On the second floor, the jali extends and blurs the boundaries from the family room to the green-walled open courtyard to the outside. 

Despite the small scale of the building, it stands apart from the neighbouring villas.
