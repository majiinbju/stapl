Caption:

At the ground floor level facing Palm Beach road, is a large 5 meter wide entrance canopy that runs along the length of the building. On one side of the covered granite clad driveway are the entrances to the two wings that further lead to the carpark at the back and on the other a landscaped area with a water feature to cut down noise from the busy road.

Towards the rear, above the carpark is the community space that comprises of a large 40,000 sq.ft. podium that is elaborately landscaped with the clubhouse located at the far end. The pergolas on the clubhouse capture a play of light and shadows. The highlight of the landscape is the temple which has glass fa√ßade on three sides. Its base rests on a water body and is accessed through stepping stones which gives it a floating effect. Amphitheatre like seating spaces have been created with the use of hardscape to overlook the softscape. Travertine-clad on the facade of the clubhouse, interspersed in the landscape and compound walls gives a monolithic character to the space.
