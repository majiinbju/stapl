Caption: The floor space index on the residential plot was 1.5. The location of the built form was obvious but had its own challenges. The building had to be set along the shorter directions using up all the frontage that we had to capture the view of Palm Beach road, the mangroves, the creek, the city of Mumbai and the sunset beyond. The built form had to go vertical capturing as much frontage as possible. As a result, Emerald Bay is structured into two identical wings, ground plus 29 upper, that contains 28 identical apartments each wing. Each apartment is a four bedroom apartment that measures around 2700 sq.ft. The living and three of the bedrooms of each apartment face the view. The living room towards the front and the dining at the back ensure ample cross ventilation. The living room is attached with a large 20 ft. wide cantilevered deck with wooden soffits, seamless glass railings. The decks project into the natural surroundings, providing expansive, panoramic views of the sea and the sunset. Large double glazed windows ensure sound and heat insulation and optimize the ventilation whilst capturing the sunâ€™s complete trajectory, from sunrise to sunset.
