For the interiors of its office, we had tried to incorporate the character of this family-run business. Largely stream-lined by two generations working in tandem-individual approaches have been highlighted & seamlessly integrated to create a unified whole. The company philosophy & art have been used to interplay the corporate image. 

The 'man-machine' sculpture at the entrance. 'The recurring womb' in the MD's Cabin; the teacher in the Senior MD's cabin; the 'Taking flight' in the junior MDs cabin; the 'divine power' and the guiding 'Banyan' all visually reiterate the concepts and integrity of the company they exemplify. 

Looking to the future while rooted in traditional Indian beginnings, Greenscape Developers is deeply involved in the construction & realty industry in and around India. With every project, it has reÂ­invented itself; growing, evolving, redefining & setting new milestones.
