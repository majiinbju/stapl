Located in its flag-ship, corporate building Cyberone, the Greenscape Developers office had scored a first on many counts. This was a chance to create a space that would be in-sync with their brand identity, in a building synonymous with their brand & ideologies. Their office would reflect their ethos, and the quality of spaces that they created vis-a-vis their buildings. 

The plan was structured along the movement of the guest to the office. Clear demarcations between the public, semi-public and private spaces became central to the design. 

The spaces were distinguished using a changing palette of materials. For instance, the public spaces were crafted using random-cut travertine marble as flooring, large expanse of layered veneer paneling & a geometric fretwork jali that defined the boundary to the semi-public areas beyond. Three hidden doors leading to three different parts of office form the access hereon. One camouflaged door which is off-limits for guests is the work area for the office team. The second door leads to the conference room. The third door leads to the private reception for the CEOs. As one moved into the semi-private spaces the decor gets muted down. The flooring changes to a soft carpet and the wall cladding to a tiger onyx in the private reception area. A cafe for the guests; a personalized waiting room, an informal meeting room & the three main cabins. The three main cabins largely reflect the role and personality of the individual users.
