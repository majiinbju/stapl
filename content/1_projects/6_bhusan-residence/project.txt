This 4 BHK residence is a prime example of a creating a clean and uncomplicated design. Experimenting with sandstone and wood; the look and feel of the apartment was set right from the entrance. 

To accommodate an extra guest room; we explored the opportunity to create an open kitchen and dining area. This layout now demanded privacy and segregation at the entrance from the kitchen. A screen using mirrors was thus added. This framed the view to the living and restricted the view of the dining. This first impression of the apartment doubled up the space and created an illusion at the entrance. This created 3 distinct zones in the living space as the entrance, living & kitchen-dining space. 

Three large bedrooms with attached bathrooms and one tiny guestroom made up the other spaces. Two of the bathrooms have a walk-in closet attached. This was a challenge as space was a constraint. The use of hanging lights, focus lights and chandelier has created a layered light design. 

An attempt to add a textural quality into the monochrome creates a vivid palette using Italian marble, stone and veneer in the spaces. This is an attempt to create drama and balance within a conventional residential space design.
