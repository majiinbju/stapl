Caption: The villa plots are located on the ring road that run along the outside of the central green. Villas are of varying sizes based on individual plot sizes. Each villa was a four bedroom villa provided with its private pool. The planning of the individual villas was done with a specific intent The plan was to make every villa unidirectional, the living, dining and all the four bedrooms, were oriented to face the front of the plot that abutted the road. Other areas such as the kitchen, the servant quarters and the family room on the first floor faced the rear of the plot. Other activities such as the den and the home theatre were located in the basement. The villa itself was located towards the rear end of the plot increasing the front open space. The living, dining and one of the bedrooms on the ground floor open up on to this front open space. The three bedrooms on the first floor have a large cantilevered balcony that overlooks this front open space. The cantilevered balcony provides for a covered patio for the living, dining and bedroom below. Large slim line windows on the lower and the upper floors provide unrestricted views of the landscape and private pool within the plot and the central green space beyond. The focus throughout the project was on the landscape, the attempt was to unbuild rather than build and to closely integrate architecture into an existing natural surrounds.
