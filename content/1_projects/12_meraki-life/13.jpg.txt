Caption:

Taking cues from the rugged landscape around, the cladding inside the villa is primarily in various local stone. For instance, the staircase and guest bedroom on the ground floor are clad in horizontal stacks of slate stone. This cladding is visualized as a monolithic element and extends into the exterior of the villa. 

The woodwork collectively ties the house together through the wooden staircase and flooring; the wooden ceiling, paneling and the fins. The cladding in the master bedroom is in semi-dressed basalt stone neatly fitted in with the woodwork. The decor is visualized as a holistic material palette built into the house integrated to form a complete idea. 

The garden forms the larger half of the villa with a fruit garden, a barbeque pit with seating, open lawns and a private pool. A waterfall from the edge of the pool along the staircase that takes you down to the entry point again. Wooden deck and the pool side here connect you to the private garden. External cladding is done using slatted natural stone blending with the mountain backdrop. The natural rock excavated from site has been reused as a construction material and a landscape feature; likewise the existing mango trees have been built around; retaining the natural elements existing on site.
