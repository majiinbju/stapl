Caption:

Villa 19 was the first of the villas to be built on the site. It was a result of a series of soul-searching debates and discussions about whether to obscure the built-form rather than mount it on a pedestal as a landmark. 
The plot is a largish rectangle (almost Â½ acre) wherein you enter the villa from the longer side, at the corner. 

The entry is from a lower contour thereby slowly unveiling details and spaces within the villa. A waterfall on the right aligns itself to the garden entry while the straight inclined pathway leads to a double height sky-lit lobby. 
Through it one is drawn into the large living room with huge windows on two adjacent sides that practically blurs the margins between the interior space; the outdoor pool deck and garden area. 

The furniture is arranged to maximise the view of the outside; making it impossible to forget where we are. Moving inwards leads to the open kitchen that overlooks into a kitchen garden at the east and the hill beyond. It is designed as the core of the house connecting to the staircase, the lift, the servant entry, the guest bedroom and the common washroom. The house is spread over 3-storeys - a basement by virtue of the contour; ground level that houses the living, kitchen, one bedroom and the first floor that houses 3 bedrooms & the family room that overlooks the entrance lobby. All the 4 bedrooms overlook the poolside garden. Large span windows allow west views of the surrounding from the first floor.
