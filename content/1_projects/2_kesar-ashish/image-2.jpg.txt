Caption:

As a result, the apartments are spread over three towers of 24 storeys - two towards the Linking road and one towards the 18 meter wide road, overlooking each other across the podium that separates them. The apartments comprise 2-bhk & 3 BHK units; cross-ventilated with decks attached to the living room. The podium garden fulfils the social requirements of the residents that include a swimming pool, party lawn and a children’s play area. Parking, an urgent need of every residential and commercial property has been thoughtfully planned on the lower floors maximizing privacy for the residents.  
The mass of the façade is structured into slender, vertical fins while the balconies form the intermittent horizontal grid.
