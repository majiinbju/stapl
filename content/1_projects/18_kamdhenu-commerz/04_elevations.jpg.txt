Caption: Retail shopping had to be provided on the ground and the first floor of the project since it was abutting two major roads. This consumed a large area on the ground floor, the rest of the area on the ground was structured to form the entrance driveway that ran along the north side of the plot. This led to the main entrance lobby and the cafeteria, business center and the conference room connected through the same. Part of the ground floor is further used to accommodate essential services and carparking; and a ramp access leads to parking on first and second floors
