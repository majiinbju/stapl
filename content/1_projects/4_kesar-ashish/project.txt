The location of this site is in Kandivali, in the western suburbs of Mumbai. Over the last 2 decades the locality has grown in leaps and bounds supported by the city1s ever changing infrastructure. This has invited a significant proliferation of residents. 

The project is strategically located between two roads; the main 36 meter wide Linking road and the 18 meter wide service road. This dichotomy of the roads around the plot has defined the mixed use design, distinctly segregating the circulation required for the retail & residential sections.
 
The retail shopping is designed to maximize foot fall from the 36 meter wide main road frontage. The shops occupy the ground & first floor. The entry to the residential apartments is from the 18 mts service road; minimizing the hazards of ongoing traffic. The residences are planned on the upper floors to get the uninterrupted views of the green top podium, the Joggers park, municipal garden and the seafront towards the west.
