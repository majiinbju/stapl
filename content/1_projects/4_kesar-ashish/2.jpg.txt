As a result, the apartments are spread over three towers of 24 storeys - two towards the Linking with 36 meter road and one towards the 18 meter wide road, overlooking each other across the podium that separates them. The apartments comprise 2 BHK & 3 BHK units; cross-ventilated with decks attached to the living room. The podium garden fulfils the social requirements of the residents that include a swimming pool, party lawn and a children's play area. Parking, an urgent need of every residential and commercial property has been consciously planned on the lower floors maximizing privacy for the residents.
