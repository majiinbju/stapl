**THE ARCHITECT HAS DEFINED THE MASS USING GLASS AS A VISUAL TEXTURE
**

It is a corner facing plot flanked by road on two adjacent sides. The site is located on the landmass that is protruding out into the north western direction towards Mumbai into the creek. It has dynamic views of the city around; the north-west front overlooks the Sion­Panvel highway and the south-east overlooks the sea.

Maximising the view of the cityscape, the footprint of the building reflects the shape of the land-mass. 

As the building is located on marshy land, there was no possibility of creating a multi-layered basement. As parking was an important functional requirement, it was spread over the lower 6 floors. Due to the shape of the plot, the corner was ideal to locate the ramp. The parking cylinder is a solid mass punctuated with horizontal slits that filters the light in during the day & filters the light out after dusk.
