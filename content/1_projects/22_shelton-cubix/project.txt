The project is located in the Central Business District of Navi Mumbai. The plot has a road towards the west, and has plots abutting it in the north, south and the east. The floor space index available on the plot was 1.5 and the land use was commercial. Since the upcomming airport was in the vicinity, the rise on the building was restricted to 45 mts.

The large quantum of car park required made it necessary to build a basement and upper floors for car parking. Since there were abutting plots with buildings built on them it was nescessary to position the built form with respect to the surrounding structures. The west had the road and was open, thus most of the offices had to be placed viewing the front. However, due to aviation restrictions and office sizes required, all the area could not be accomodated in the front. The advantage on the rear was that the abutting plot to the east, had a low rise structure. The area that could not be consumed in the front towards the west could now be accomodated facing east.
