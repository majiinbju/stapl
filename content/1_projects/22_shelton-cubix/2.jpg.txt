The layout was organised with the offices facing the east and west side; and a central service core. This gave an oppurtunity of sculpting the fagade. Pushing the mass in and out created a mix of offices of varying sizes. White aluminium composite panels then run along the fagade to create a serpentine connectivity. The fagade using white aluminum composite panels and this along with high performance double glazed units glass dominates the fagade facing the the west and the east. Towards the side in the south and the north is where the service core opens up. 

At the ground is a granite clad driveway with a large glass canopy that leads to the lobby and the car park beyond. Across the lobby is a landscape area that acts as a buffer between the road and the internal space. 

At times the functional clarity of the plan allows for a form-based design; thus proving an age-old adage that, 'Form follows function'.
