**SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION **

- 650 SO.MT= 14 villas 700 SO.MT = 2 Villas 
- 750 SO.MT= 7 Villas 1000 SO.MT= 4 Villas

  Family Room and Bed Rooms 


The site is located in Kunegoan, Lonavala. Lonavala being a hill station and having a close proximity to both Pune and Mumbai city, has attracted a lot of people to build or buy weekend/second homes. The site is approximately 10.5 acres in area and has a shape of two intersecting rectangles. The entrance is towards the west and is the lowest part of site. As we enter the site the contours on the site rise upwards towards the east, the backdrop of which is the hill The level difference between the entry to the west and the hills towards the east is approximately 28 meters. Towards the south is located Della adventure park and towards the north is barren land. 

The brief was to build a gated weekend retreat. The masterplan that was generated was done with a clear intention to negotiate the contours with a ring road and to centrally locate the common green spaces. All the villa subplots were thus automatically pushed to the periphery of the site. The connecting internal road now traversed between the central green and the frontage of the individual villas. This ensured, each villa a view of the central green space.
