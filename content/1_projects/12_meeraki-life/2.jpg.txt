Caption:

The central green space was largely contoured. Within it was developed a walking trail that was densely planted on either side, to ensure that people using the trail would be obscured from the villas outside and vice versa. Within the landscape is also located a small flattened lawn area for multipurpose activities. Toward the upper end of the green area where the contours were steepest is located the clubhouse.

Due to the steep slopes the clubhouse naturally sinks into the landscape giving way to a mound of grass on its roof top, making it an earth sheltered built form. The intention clearly was to make unfettered landscape, to become the focus, rather than the built form. The concrete finish clubhouse building is planned such that the restaurant overlooks both the internal courtyard that houses the lotus pool with the waterfall and the main swimming pool towards the outside. The main swimming pool further steps down the contours in the form of a waterfall, to form the children's pool. Extensive landscape on the clubhouse building and the area surrounding the pool ensure that people using the facility feel encompassed by nature.
