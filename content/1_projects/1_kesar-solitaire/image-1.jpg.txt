Caption: Standing apart on Palm Beach Road; Navi Mumbai’s most vibrant road, enjoying a view of the green mangrove-cover and the creek beyond is an office building ‘Kesar Solitaire’. With the shorter side facing the view, it was essential to locate all the offices facing the prominent viewing direction and positioning the service core towards the rear. However with a car parking requirement of 450 cars, it was essential to build three basements and a few upper floors for car parking.
