Accessed by a narrow street, flanked by bungalows near Central Park at Kharghar, this residence is instantly noticeable because of it streamlined exposed concrete fa9ade with a perforated pattern. With roads on two parallel sides, this home has open undisturbed views of the main access road and the park beyond. 

It is spread over four levels; the entry level is the lobby & core, car parking area and servants quarters. The core that runs through the entire house has a staircase and lift. On the second level are the family recreational spaces. This includes an elevated pool, steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, massage room, home theatre, guest suite and well-equipped gym. Though the look is kept simple, the functional requirements include almost everything that you can boast of. 

The third level houses the living rooms, the kitchen, dining and the master suite. The fourth level houses the family temple (pooja ghar) in the center along with a tiny open court; surrounded by four bedrooms.
