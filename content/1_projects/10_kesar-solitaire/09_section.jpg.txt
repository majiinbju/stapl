Caption: On the ground floor, facing the Palm Beach road, is an entrance driveway that is covered by a large glass canopy. The landscape has stepped lawn and a water element which complements the simple, straight-line architecture of the building. A large double height entrance lobby beyond the canopy, houses a seating lounge and waterfall.
