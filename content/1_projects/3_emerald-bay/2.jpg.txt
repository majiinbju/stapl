cantilevered deck with wooden soffits, seamless glass railings. The decks project into the natural surroundings, providing expansive, panoramic views of the sea and the sunset Large double glazed windows ensure sound and heat insulation and optimize the ventilation whilst capturing the sun's complete trajectory, from sunrise to sunset At the ground floor level facing Palm Beach road, is a large 5 meter wide entrance canopy that runs along the length of the building. On one side of the covered granite clad driveway are the entrances to the two wings that further lead to the car park at the back and on the other a landscaped area with a water feature to cut down noise from the busy road.

Towards the rear, above the car park is the community space that comprises of a large 40,000 sq.ft podium that is elaborately landscaped with the clubhouse located at the far end. The pergolas on the clubhouse capture a play of light and shadows. The highlight of the landscape is the temple which has glass fagade on three sides. Its base rests on a water body and is accessed through stepping stones which gives it a floating effect Amphitheatre like seating spaces have been created with the use of hardscape to overlook the softscape. Travertine-clad on the fagade of the clubhouse, interspersed in the landscape and compound walls gives a mono I ith ic character to the space. 

A large pool, basketball court, a gym, table-tennis, billiards and banquet room complete the amenities. A larger-than-life interactive chess board, children's covered play area and the interplay of hard and soft surfaces complete the outdoor common spaces. The structure fits into the heterogeneous typology of the existing architecture around & justifies the commercial order of the neighbourhood.
