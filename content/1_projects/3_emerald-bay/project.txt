The site is located on a prime stretch of the Palm Beach road in Navi Mumbai. Towards the east where the plot is located, lies a stretch of some of the most luxurious and expensive apartments and condos in the city. The plot is rectangular with the shorter side facing the viewing direction. The access is through the service road towards the west, running parallel to Palm Beach road and another service road that is on the east.
 
The floor space index on the residential plot was 1 .5. The location of the built form was obvious but had its own challenges The building had to be set along the shorter directions using up all the frontage that we had to capture the view of Palm Beach road, the mangroves, the creek, the city of Mumbai and the sunset beyond. The built form had to go vertical capturing as much frontage as possible. As a result, Emerald Bay is structured into two identical wings, ground plus 29 upper, that contains 28 identical apartments each wing. Each apartment is a four bedroom apartment that measures around 2700 sq.ft The living and three of the bedrooms of each apartment face the view The living room towards the main road and the dining room towards the landscaped podium. The living room is attached with a large 20 ft wide
