Caption:

The rest of the office space starts from the 7th floor onwards up to the 24th floor. 
Essentially a composition of a cylinder & two interlocking cuboids with a tapering top; the building stands tall at 110 m. Since the height to width facade ratio is huge; the building mass has been broken into two cuboids. One cuboidsâ€™ panels are composed in 3 different shades; while the other is in a single monotone. This creates a moving visual matrix. The facade of the building is done up in a double glaze Low E soft coat glass. The system for putting up the panels is a unitised system of construction. It is a 5 barrier system to prevent water from getting in. The three shades that have been used are Silver 20, Silver Grey 32 & Light Blue 52.
