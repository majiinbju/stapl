Caption: As the building is located on marshy land, there was no possibility of creating a multi-layered basement. As parking was an important functional requirement, it was spread over the lower 6 floors.  Due to the shape of the plot, the corner was ideal to locate the ramp. The parking cylinder is a solid mass punctuated with horizontal slits that filters the light in during the day & filters the light out after dusk. The car parking frontage produces the effect of a canopy going upto the sixth floor of the building. Internally, frosted glass to allow light to get into the parking section. At night, it lights up like a lantern.  The vertical screens of glass creates a play; adding a bar code like element of colour.
