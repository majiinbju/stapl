With the shorter side facing the view, it was essential to locate all the offices facing the prominent viewing direction and positioning the service core towards the rear. However with a car parking requirement of 450 cars, it was essential to build three basements and a few upper floors for car parking.

Kesar Solitaire is a clean-cut, neat, straight line building. Hidden behind this essentially simple aesthetics, is an integrated structural and spatial design. The typical floor-plate spans 28 floors of column-free office space. This gives flexibility to accommodate small and large offices both. The RCC frame structure in M70 grade of self-compacting concrete, provides the necessary column-free space. The structural system follows a repetitive grid with sleeves left for easy integration of other ancillary systems like air-conditioning, fire-fighting and electrical; directly connecting it to the service areas at the rear. 

The double glazed high performance glazed exterior provides panoramic views and ample lighting for each office also serves to act as a thermal insulation against the heat.
