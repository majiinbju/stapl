Caption:

The structure is a large span column free space on the floor plate to cater to the requirements of IT offices. The front forms a large linear expanse of about 64m. This is also largely the north eastern direction creating ambient ‘north’ lighting within the office areas; while the service areas have been deliberately pushed to the south-west of the building. The Lifts are Mikonic-10 elevators with port technology; first-of-its-kind in India and the 8th in the world; when it was installed. 
The landscape forms a complementary element to the buildings architecture.
