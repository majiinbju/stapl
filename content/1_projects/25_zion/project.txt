The site is located in a predominantly residential neighborhood of Kharghar. Towards the northeast and the northwest runs the national highway and towards the south west the main entrance road and a residential sector of Kharghar. 

Since this office building was located in a dense residential neighborhood it was important to create a building with a strong visual focus. The offices are oriented away from the highway to cut down the sound of traffic. The offices now faced southwest. This increased direct heat gain and direct sunlight. The building fac;:ade was a response to these challenges. A conscious attempt has been made to use an unconventional color palette. The fac;:ade is a composition of grey and gold glass to take care of the direct heat and sunlight. The massing composition has been achieved by creating larger and smaller offices. 

The car parking has been restricted to the basement. As one drives in, the entrance lobby comes to the left and elaborately landscaped garden on the right. Attached to the lobby is a business center, a conference room and a restaurant all of them overlooking the landscape. 

As a result, a subtle interplay of form, juxtaposed with colour creates a space that resonates with energy and lives up to its functional aspiration.
