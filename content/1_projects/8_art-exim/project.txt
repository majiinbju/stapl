A privately owned export house spread over 6500 sq. ft. was an interesting office of sorts. It was different from other offices as it was an amalgamation of 3 offices under one roof. Each distinct in itself yet similarly fashioned from a single thought. 

The office exudes the warmth of personal styling set against the corporate monotone of grey, white with wood. Larger than life colour accents, painting collection by the clients became accessories to the design ethos. 

The plan was structured around a single reception serving the three distinct offices. The design was a conscious movement from the public to the semipublic and then the private office spaces. The reception connected to 2 meetings rooms that formed the meeting area for general guests. 

The look and feel though identical was characterized by one changing element in each section. The colour red formed the highlight for one of the office. The second office was highlighted in shades of blue. This was in keeping with their brand and corporate colours. The third office was simply designed in a material palette of greys.
