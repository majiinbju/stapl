Caption: The layout was organised with the offices facing the east and west side; and a central service core. This gave an oppurtunity of sculpting the façade. Pushing the façade in and out created a mix of offices of varying sizes. White aluminium composite panels then run along the façade to create a serpentine connectivity. The facade using white aluminum composite panels and high performance double glazed units glass dominates the façade facing the the west and the east. Towards the side in the south and the north is where the service core opens up.
